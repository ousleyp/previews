# previews

notes on the build-preview.sh script:

- read the comments before using :)
- it won't work if you don't run it from the openshift-docs directory
- the script assumes that openshift-docs and previews have the same parent
  in my case, they're in a directory called "repos":
  
  $ ls ~/repos
  openshift-docs previews
